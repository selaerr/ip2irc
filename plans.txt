kernel -> tun iface [ => base64 => irc bot ]
[ irc bot => base64 => ] tun iface -> kernel

this software only handles the connection of "edges"!!
it does not handle connecting to the internal network itself,
which happens via other software implementing BGP.
the only thing you will get access to is the 10.69.0.0/24 subnet!

receiving L2 packets (IP)

docker run --name ircd --network host -p 6667:6667 inspircd/inspircd-docker

export CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc

can receive on linux - does not reply on irc but did before?
nvm just `modprobe tun`
